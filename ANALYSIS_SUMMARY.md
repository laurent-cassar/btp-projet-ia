## ❌ WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

### Critical Missing Features
- ❌ **File Upload Processing**: Route exists but placeholder only
  - Can't parse PDF/DOCX/PPTX/TXT files
  - Need to implement file parsing

- ❌ **Database Persistence**: PostgreSQL configured but not actively used
  - Quizzes stored in memory only (lost on refresh)
  - Need to enable database saves/retrieval

- ❌ **User Authentication**: Not implemented
  - No login/signup system
  - All users see same quizzes
  - Can't track user-specific data

### Medium Priority Issues
- ⚠️ **Interactive Quiz Taking**: Users can't click answers
  - Currently display-only, not interactive
  - No scoring/grading system
  - No user answer tracking

- ⚠️ **Automated Testing**: No test suite
  - Only manual testing documented
  - Should add Jest/React Testing Library

- ⚠️ **API Error Edge Cases**: Most paths covered but some gaps
  - File size validation missing
  - Network timeout handling partial
  - Some error scenarios not covered

### Lower Priority Improvements
- Quiz sharing functionality
- PDF/DOCX export capability
- User analytics/statistics
- Advanced quiz filtering/search
