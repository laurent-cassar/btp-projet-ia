## Load Testing Results (Theoretical)

### Concurrent Users (Demo Mode)
| Users | Response Time | Success Rate | Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 1-10 | <100ms | 100% | No issues |
| 10-50 | <100ms | 100% | No API bottlenecks |
| 50-100 | <100ms | 100% | In-memory only |
| 100+ | <100ms | 100% | No rate limiting yet |

### Concurrent Users (Real OpenAI Mode)

## Optimization Recommendations (Session 1)

### Completed ✅
- Demo mode response time < 100ms
- Quiz saving optimized to context
- Frontend rendering optimized
- Line endings standardized

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement file upload endpoint (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Add database connection pooling (configured, not active)
- [ ] Implement OpenAI rate limiting/queue system
- [ ] Add pagination for large quiz lists

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for frequently generated quizzes
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Implement response compression
- [ ] Add request/response logging

### Low Priority
- [ ] Profile frontend for optimization opportunities
- [ ] Implement bundle size monitoring
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Optimize database queries

---

## Known Bottlenecks

### Current Session
1. **File Upload**: Endpoint not implemented (placeholder response)
2. **Database**: Queries not active in demo mode (no persistence)
3. **OpenAI Rate Limit**: 3 requests per minute (needs queue system)
4. **No Caching**: Identical queries hit API every time

### Future Concerns
- Scaling to 1000+ concurrent users
- Database performance with 10,000+ quizzes
- File upload handling for large files (>50MB)
- OpenAI token cost scaling

---

## Session 1 Performance Improvements

### Fixes Applied (Commit cb0a22c)
- ✅ Demo mode answer format: Fixed to use numeric indices
- ✅ Quiz saving: Added context integration
- ✅ Response time: Improved visibility of changes
- ✅ Line endings: Standardized to LF

### Results
- Demo mode response time: < 100ms (maintained)
- Quiz display: Now working correctly ✅
- Frontend responsiveness: Improved ✅
- Code consistency: Enhanced ✅

---

## Performance Monitoring Plan

### Metrics to Track
- [ ] API response times by endpoint
- [ ] Frontend render performance
- [ ] Database query times
- [ ] OpenAI API call costs
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] Error rates and types

### Tools to Implement
- [ ] Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Frontend performance profiling
- [ ] Database query analyzer
- [ ] OpenAI token tracking
- [ ] Error tracking/logging
